# OpenCV Aimbot 🤖

<p align="center"><img width="80%" src="terraria-aimbot.png"/></p>

Made for the video game Terraria (because I like Terraria (and I'm bad at aiming))

# Instructions
1. Change the variable window_name to whatever name Terraria's window happens to be (because it changes upon each launch)
2. To enable the aimbot, press "r"
3. To disable the aimbot, press "r"

# TODO
- Sometimes pressing "r" does not toggle the aimbot. Fix this.
- Aimbot could be a bit faster; currently searching for the needle in the haystack using multiple size profiles is slowing it down.
- Different zoom levels result in varying degrees of the aimbot's ability to find the needle.
